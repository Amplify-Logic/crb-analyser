# CRB Analyser: Go-To-Market Strategy
## Research-Backed Plan for Zero/Low Budget Launch

---

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive research of successful bootstrapped SaaS companies (Jasper, Copy.ai, Basecamp), community analysis, and current market conditions, this strategy prioritizes **product-led growth** through the free quiz funnel, combined with **community engagement** on LinkedIn and Reddit, and a carefully timed **Product Hunt launch**.

**Key Insight**: Both Jasper and Copy.ai succeeded by:
1. Building for an audience they knew intimately (6-8 years of experience)
2. Launching with a narrow wedge (specific use cases, not broad tools)
3. Building in public on Twitter/X
4. Leveraging freemium for bottom-up adoption

**Recommendation**: Focus on **Marketing Agencies** as the initial vertical - they understand ROI, have budget authority, and actively seek efficiency tools.

## Section 1: Prioritized Channel List

### Tier 1: Primary Channels (80% of effort)

| Channel | Effort | Cost | Speed | Scalability | Brand Fit | Priority |
|---------|--------|------|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **LinkedIn Organic** | Medium | Free | 2-4 weeks | High | Excellent | #1 |
| **Reddit Communities** | Medium | Free | 1-2 weeks | Medium | Good | #2 |
| **Product Hunt Launch** | High | Free | 1 day spike | Low | Excellent | #3 |

### Tier 2: Supporting Channels (20% of effort)

| Channel | Effort | Cost | Speed | Scalability | Brand Fit | Priority |
|---------|--------|------|-------|-------------|-----------|----------|
| **SEO/Content** | High | Free | 3-6 months | Very High | Excellent | #4 |
| **IndieHackers** | Low | Free | 1-2 weeks | Low | Excellent | #5 |

### Channels to AVOID (for now)

| Channel | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **AppSumo** | 30-70% revenue share, attracts deal-seekers not ideal customers, usage-based AI costs could drain you |
| **Meta/Facebook Ads** | Poor B2B targeting, high CAC for low-ticket items |
| **Cold Email** | Damages brand, low conversion, time-intensive |
| **YouTube** | High production effort, slow ROI for solo founder |

---

## Section 2: CAC Targets & Unit Economics

### Your Pricing Reality

| Tier | Price | Target LTV | Max CAC (3:1) | Max CAC (5:1) |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|---------------|
| Quick Report | €47 | €47 (one-time) | €15.67 | €9.40 |
| Full Analysis | €297 | €297 (one-time) | €99 | €59.40 |

**Critical Insight**: At €47, you cannot afford paid acquisition. Your CAC must be near-zero, which means:
- Free quiz must convert at 5-10%+ to Quick Report
- Organic channels only
- Word-of-mouth/referrals essential

### Recommended Pricing Adjustment

Consider adding a **€19 "Snapshot Report"** tier:
- 5 key findings only
- No vendor recommendations
- Positions €47 as the "smart choice"
- Captures price-sensitive buyers
- Still unprofitable for paid ads, but increases funnel conversion

## Section 4: Content Calendar (First 30 Days)

- 20% Personal stories
- 10% Direct CTA to quiz

### Week 1 Content

| Day | Type | Topic | Hook |
|-----|------|-------|------|
| Mon | Story | Why I built this | "Last year, I watched a friend waste €15K on AI tools that didn't fit their business..." |
| Wed | Educational | AI readiness signs | "5 signs your business is NOT ready for AI (and that's okay)" |
| Fri | Contrarian | Honest positioning | "Most AI tools want to sell you AI. I built one that sometimes tells you not to buy." |

### Week 2 Content

| Day | Type | Topic | Hook |
|-----|------|-------|------|
| Mon | Data/Insight | Industry stats | "87% of SMBs are curious about AI. Only 12% have a clear ROI case. Here's why..." |
| Wed | How-to | Evaluate AI ROI | "How to calculate if that AI tool is actually worth it (free framework)" |
| Fri | CTA | Quiz promotion | "I built a free AI readiness quiz. In 5 minutes, you'll know if AI makes sense for your business." |

### Week 3 Content

| Day | Type | Topic | Hook |

---

## Section 5: Reddit Strategy

### Target Subreddits (by priority)

| Subreddit | Members | Relevance | Approach |
|-----------|---------|-----------|----------|
| r/Entrepreneur | 3.5M+ | High | General AI/automation questions |
| r/smallbusiness | 1.5M+ | Very High | Practical business automation |
| r/marketing | 700K+ | High | Marketing automation specifically |
| r/agencies | 50K+ | Very High | Target vertical |
| r/SaaS | 100K+ | Medium | Founder community, building in public |

### Reddit Engagement Rules

1. **First 2 weeks**: ONLY comment, add value, build karma
2. **Never** directly post your link in subreddits
3. **Always** disclose you're the founder when mentioning your product
4. **Best approach**: Answer a question thoroughly, then add "I actually built something for this..."
5. **Track**: Which subreddits drive quiz signups

### Example Reddit Comment (after building credibility)

> Great question! The ROI calculation for AI tools is tricky because most vendors inflate the numbers.
>
> Here's how I'd think about it:
> 1. Calculate actual hours spent on the task today
> 2. Estimate realistic time savings (usually 30-50%, not 80% like vendors claim)
> 3. Factor in learning curve (usually 2-4 weeks of reduced productivity)
> 4. Add ongoing costs (subscription + maintenance + occasional failures)
>
> Full disclosure: I built a free quiz that does this calculation automatically. Happy to share if you're interested, but the framework above works manually too.

## Section 10: Answers to Specific Questions

### 1. Should we focus on one industry vertical first? Which one?

**Yes. Focus on Marketing Agencies.**

Reasons:
- They understand ROI calculations (your core value prop)
- They have discretionary budget
- Founder/decision-maker is often the same person (shorter sales cycle)
- They're actively looking for efficiency (margins are tight)
- They're on LinkedIn (your primary channel)
- Jasper AI's early success was with marketers

### 2. Is the free quiz enough to drive organic sharing?

**Partially.** The quiz needs a shareable output:
- Create a "share your AI readiness score" graphic
- Add social sharing buttons to results page
- Consider a "compare with industry average" feature
- Add a referral program: "Get your full report free when 3 friends complete the quiz"

### 3. What's the minimum viable content strategy?

**3 LinkedIn posts per week + 5 Reddit comments per day.**

Time investment: ~1 hour/day
- 20 min: Write/schedule LinkedIn post
- 20 min: Engage on LinkedIn (comments, connections)
- 20 min: Reddit engagement

### 4. How do we get first 100 paying customers?

**Path to 100 customers:**

| Source | Customers | Timeline |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Personal network | 5-10 | Week 1-2 |
| IndieHackers beta | 5-10 | Week 2-4 |
| LinkedIn organic | 20-30 | Month 1-2 |
| Reddit engagement | 10-20 | Month 1-2 |
| Product Hunt launch | 10-30 | Launch week |
| Referrals from above | 20-30 | Month 2-3 |

### 5. What's the CAC we can afford?

| Tier | Max CAC |
|------|---------|
| €47 Quick Report | €10-15 (realistically must be near-zero) |
| €297 Full Analysis | €50-100 |

**Bottom line**: You cannot profitably acquire €47 customers through paid channels. Focus on organic, referral, and product-led growth.

## Section 11: Partnership Opportunities

### Non-Competitive Partners Who Serve Your Audience

| Partner Type | Example | Opportunity |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Accountants/Bookkeepers | Small firm CPAs | Referral for ROI analysis |
| Business Coaches | Ops/growth coaches | White-label or affiliate |
| Web Agencies | Dev shops | Recommend to clients considering AI |
| VA Services | Virtual assistant companies | Identify automation opportunities |
| SaaS Review Sites | G2, Capterra | Free listing, collect reviews |

### Affiliate Program Structure (Future)

- 20-30% of first purchase
- Cookie duration: 90 days
- Focus on accountants, business coaches, consultants
- Provide co-branded landing pages

---

## Section 12: If You Had €500/Month

### Recommended Allocation

| Channel | Amount | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| LinkedIn Premium | €60 | InMail credits, better targeting |
| Newsletter Sponsorship | €200 | 1 placement in relevant newsletter |
| Google Ads (high-intent) | €150 | "AI ROI calculator" type keywords |
| Tools/Buffer | €50 | Scheduling, analytics |
| Reserve | €40 | Opportunistic spending |

### Newsletter Sponsorships to Consider

Look for newsletters targeting SMB founders:
- Morning Brew (expensive but effective)
- The Hustle
- Indie Hackers Newsletter
- Niche marketing newsletters (cheaper, more targeted)

Budget: €100-300 per placement for smaller newsletters

---

## Section 13: What NOT to Do

### Common Bootstrapper Mistakes

1. **Spreading too thin**: Pick 2-3 channels, dominate them
2. **Premature paid ads**: Don't buy ads until organic converts
3. **AppSumo too early**: Lifetime deals with AI costs = death spiral
4. **Cold outreach**: Damages honest brand positioning
5. **Perfectionism**: Launch fast, iterate based on feedback
6. **Ignoring unit economics**: Know your CAC limits

### Specific Warnings

- **Don't buy LinkedIn automation tools** - Account bans, brand damage
- **Don't post and ghost on Reddit** - Build genuine presence first
- **Don't optimize for vanity metrics** - Quiz completions mean nothing if nobody pays
- **Don't ignore negative feedback** - Your "honest" positioning means listening

---

## Appendix: Competitive Positioning

### Existing AI Readiness Assessments

| Competitor | Focus | Weakness |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Microsoft | Enterprise | Too complex for SMBs |
| Cisco | Infrastructure | Technical, not business |
| Salesforce | CRM integration | Vendor-biased |
| Generic consultants | Custom | €5K+ pricing |

### Your Differentiation

1. **SMB-focused**: Not enterprise bloatware
2. **Impartial**: No vendor to push
3. **Affordable**: €47 vs €5K consulting
4. **Honest**: Will tell you when AI isn't right
5. **Specific**: Researches YOUR business, not generic
