# CRB Analyser - Go-To-Market Strategy

> **Status:** Pre-launch | **Target:** Direct-to-SMB | **Last Updated:** 2026-01-03

---

## Current State

- Product: Not ready to sell
- Traffic: None
- Email list: None
- Partnerships: None

This strategy assumes starting from zero.

---

## Strategic Principles

1. **Validate before scaling** - Prove conversion works manually before adding automation
2. **One channel at a time** - Master one acquisition channel before adding another
3. **No spam tactics** - Protect domain reputation; build trust-first relationships
4. **Content is the moat** - Your assessment data creates unique insights no one else has

---

## Phase 0: Pre-Launch (Now → Product Ready)

**Goal:** Build audience and validate demand before product is sellable.

### Actions

| Action | Why | Time |
|--------|-----|------|
| Start LinkedIn content | Build audience before you need it | 30 min/day |
| Collect waitlist emails | Capture interest, test messaging | 1 day setup |
| Run 5 manual assessments | Validate value prop, gather testimonials | 1-2 weeks |
| Identify 10 potential partners | Accountants, coaches, consultants | Ongoing |

### LinkedIn Content Strategy

Post 3-4x per week. Content themes:

```
Week 1-2: Problem awareness
- "Why most SMBs fail at AI adoption"
- "The 3 questions every business owner asks about AI"

Week 3-4: Insight sharing
- "I analyzed X businesses. Here's what I found..."
- "The #1 process killing productivity in [industry]"

Week 5+: Solution teasing
- "Building something to help with this..."
- "Early results from our AI readiness framework"
```

**Format:** Text posts, no links (LinkedIn suppresses external links). Add link in comments.

### Waitlist Setup

Simple landing page with:
- Headline: "Find out if your business is ready for AI"
- Subhead: "Free AI Readiness Assessment - launching soon"
- Email capture
- Optional: "What industry are you in?" dropdown

Tools: Carrd ($19/yr), Tally (free), or simple page on your domain.

### Manual Assessments

Find 5 businesses (your network, LinkedIn DMs, local) and offer:

> "I'm building an AI readiness tool for [industry]. Can I run a free assessment for you? Takes 20 min, you get a full report, I get feedback."

**Purpose:**
- Validate the report is valuable
- Get testimonials for launch
- Understand objections and questions
- Refine the product

---

## Phase 1: Launch (Product Ready → First 50 Customers)

**Goal:** Prove the funnel converts. Get first paying customers.

### Core Funnel

```
Traffic Source
     ↓
Free Quiz (5-10 min, ungated)
     ↓
Teaser Report (3 key insights shown)
     ↓
Email Gate ("Get full report")
     ↓
Full Free Report delivered
     ↓
Upsell: Paid Tier ($49-149)
  - Implementation roadmap
  - Vendor recommendations
  - Priority support
```

### Primary Channel: LinkedIn Organic

Continue content from Phase 0, but now with product live:

- Every post soft-CTAs to quiz
- Share anonymized insights from real assessments
- Celebrate customer wins (with permission)

**Target metrics:**
- 1,000 impressions/post average
- 5-10 quiz starts per week from LinkedIn
- 20% quiz → email conversion

### Secondary Channel: Partnership Pilots

Reach out to 3-5 partners for pilot:

**Targets:**
- Accountants/bookkeepers (see client finances, advise on ops)
- Business coaches (already having strategic conversations)
- Fractional COOs (process-focused, trusted advisors)
- Industry consultants (vertical expertise)

**Pitch:**

> "I built an AI readiness assessment tool for SMBs. I'd like to offer it free to 5 of your clients as a value-add from you. If they find it useful, we can talk about a referral arrangement."

**Structure:**
- Partner sends intro email
- You run the assessment
- Client gets report, partner looks smart
- If it works → formalize referral (10-20% rev share or flat fee)

### Email Nurture Sequence

Once someone downloads free report:

```
Day 0: Report delivered + "How to read this" guide
Day 3: "One quick win from your report" (personalized if possible)
Day 7: Case study / testimonial from similar business
Day 14: "Ready to go deeper?" - Paid tier pitch
Day 21: Weekly insights email (ongoing)
```

**Weekly insights email:**
- Aggregated data from assessments (anonymized)
- "This week we analyzed 12 businesses. Here's what we learned..."
- Builds trust, keeps you top of mind
- Soft CTA to paid tier or referral program

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Tool |
|--------|--------|------|
| Quiz starts / week | 20+ | Analytics |
| Quiz completion rate | 60%+ | Analytics |
| Email capture rate | 30%+ | Analytics |
| Free → Paid conversion | 5-10% | Stripe |
| Partner referral rate | Track per partner | Manual |

---

## Phase 2: Traction (50 → 500 Customers)

**Goal:** Scale what's working. Add paid channels.

### Double Down on Working Channels

By now you'll know:
- Is LinkedIn driving signups?
- Are partnerships converting?
- What's the free → paid conversion rate?

**Rule:** Only scale channels with proven CAC < LTV.

### Add: Referral Program

Once you have happy customers:

```
"Share your AI Readiness Quiz with another business owner.
If they complete it, you both unlock [bonus insight / extra report section]."
```

Simple viral loop. Quiz format is inherently shareable.

### Add: Paid Ads (Only If Funnel Converts)

**Prerequisites:**
- Free → paid conversion rate > 5%
- You know your CAC tolerance
- Landing page / quiz is optimized

**Start small:**
- $500-1000/month test budget
- Meta ads targeting business owners by industry
- Google ads for "AI for [industry]" keywords
- Retargeting quiz abandoners

**Creative approach:**
- Lead with quiz, not product
- "How AI-ready is your business? Take the 5-min quiz"
- Industry-specific variants

### Add: Content/SEO

Now that you have data, create content:

- "AI Readiness Benchmarks for [Industry] - 2025 Report"
- "How [Industry] Businesses Are Using AI (Data from 200+ Assessments)"
- Guest posts on industry publications
- Podcast appearances (you have unique data to share)

Long-term play. Takes 3-6 months to rank but compounds.

---

## Phase 3: Scale (500+ Customers)

**Goal:** Systematize and expand.

### What Changes

| Area | Phase 1-2 | Phase 3 |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Content | You write it | Hire writer / repurpose |
| Partnerships | Manual outreach | Partner portal, self-serve |
| Support | Manual | Help docs, automation |
| Verticals | 1-2 industries | Expand to adjacent |

### Consider Adding

- **Affiliate program** - Pay content creators / consultants for referrals
- **Integration partnerships** - Embed in tools SMBs already use
- **White-label tier** - If agency demand emerges organically

### Revisit Agency Channel

If you're seeing agencies/consultants sign up and request features, THEN consider the white-label play from earlier discussion.

---

## What NOT To Do

| Tactic | Why Avoid |
|--------|-----------|
| Cold email to scraped/guessed addresses | Burns domain reputation, low conversion, spammy |
| "Unlimited" cold outreach tools | They'll shut you down or you'll get blacklisted |
| Voluntary payment model | <1% conversion; charge or don't |
| Too many tools too early | Complexity before validation = wasted effort |
| Paid ads before funnel converts | Burning money to learn your funnel is broken |
| All channels at once | Diluted effort, can't tell what's working |

---

## Case Study: $250K/Month AI Agency (Jacob / Creme Digital)

> Source: YouTube interview with Jacob, 22yo founder of Creme Digital, Lovable's #1 gold agency partner. Non-technical background, started with Bubble, pivoted to vibe coding tools in early 2025.

### Pricing & Offer Structure

**Their model:**
- $9,500 for 2-week MVP
- $4,500 per 2-week sprint after that
- No negotiation, no custom scoping

**Why it works:**
- Time-boxed prevents scope creep
- Simple pricing removes friction from sales
- Sprint model keeps clients engaged long-term

**Key quote:**
> "You want to build McDonald's, not a Michelin star restaurant... No services page. Options are the death of a sale."

**Takeaway for CRB:** Consider a clear, outcome-based offer with defined timeline (e.g., "AI Readiness Report + Implementation Plan in 2 weeks for $X").

---

### Personal Brand Strategy (Low-Effort, High-Impact)

**How he built authority without video content:**

1. **Niched to a specific tool** - Became "the Lovable guy" not "the vibe coding guy"
2. **Positioned as the money-maker** - "First person to make serious money with X" vs just using it
3. **Rode the platform's wave** - Tagged Lovable in viral posts, showing results
4. **Shared market trends** - "After building 200+ products, here's what I'm seeing..."
5. **Documented the journey** - Flew to Sweden, met the team, posted about it

**Most important tweet of his career:**
> Intentionally tagged Lovable to cement himself as THE person making money with their tool.

**Content format:** Text posts + screenshots. No video needed for authority.

**Takeaway for CRB:** Position as "the AI readiness person for SMBs" - share anonymized insights from assessments, tag relevant AI tools when discussing them, document the journey.

---

### Go-to-Market Channels (Ranked by Leverage)

| Channel | How They Use It | Results |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Tool partnerships** | Lovable Partners page → RFPs flow in | Primary lead source at scale |
| **Paid ads (Meta)** | Creative-driven (repurpose viral organic posts) | Controllable volume lever |
| **Webinars** | "Mass sales call" - drove 5,000 attendees with $20K spend | Converted to cohort offer, then agency upsell |
| **Referrals** | Good work → clients refer | Steady background channel |
| **Cold outreach** | 1000+ emails/week at scale | Works but labor-intensive |

**Key insight on paid ads:**
> "It's entirely a creative game now. You don't set targeting. Just recreate what already works organically."

**Webinar funnel detail:**
- $20K ad spend → 5,000 live attendees
- Sold cohort/bootcamp (lower ticket than agency)
- Cohort graduates convert to agency clients
- Webinar = another step in funnel that makes money

**Takeaway for CRB:**
1. Partner with AI tools we recommend (vendors in KB) for referral flow
2. Test repurposing viral LinkedIn posts as ad creative
3. Consider webinar funnel: "AI Readiness Workshop" → paid assessment → implementation

---

### Founder Role & Removing Yourself

**His philosophy:**
> "Your job as founder is to take yourself out of fulfillment ASAP. Business lives and dies by go-to-market."

**Progression:**
1. Start: You do fulfillment
2. Early: Contractors (gets you to ~$10K/month)
3. Growth: Full-time employees (quality + culture)
4. Scale: Hire manager to oversee fulfillment

**What founders should focus on:**
- Go-to-market (always)
- Documenting processes (so others can execute)
- Hiring/managing people

**Takeaway for CRB:** Document the assessment + report generation process early. As volume grows, the goal is to oversee quality, not produce every report.

---

### Offer Design Principles

| Principle | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| One clear offer | "2-week MVP for $9,500" - not a services menu |
| Defined outcome | "Working product you can launch" |
| Defined timeline | "2 weeks" - prevents scope creep |
| No optionality | Don't ask "what do you want?" - tell them what they get |

**Why no services page:**
> "Nobody cares about the breakdown. They know what you're talking about. Just tell them the result and the price."

---

### Implementation Ideas for CRB

Based on this case study:

**Short-term:**
- [ ] Reach out to AI tool vendors about partner/referral relationships
- [ ] Create a "signature" positioning (e.g., "We've analyzed X businesses...")
- [ ] Design a clear, time-boxed premium offer

**Medium-term:**
- [ ] Test webinar format: "AI Readiness Workshop for [Industry]"
- [ ] Repurpose top-performing LinkedIn posts as Meta ad creative
- [ ] Build partner page for consultants/accountants to refer clients

**Long-term:**
- [ ] Document all processes for eventual team handoff
- [ ] Consider cohort model as middle-tier between free report and full implementation
