## Common Thread

All target industries are **"Passion-Driven Service Businesses"**:

- Owner-operators who make fast decisions
- Relationship-driven (clients = humans, not logos)
- Passion/craft-based (people love what they do)
- Clear operational pain (admin eats creative/service time)
- Pleasant to work with (not corporate bureaucracy)
- Mid-market sweet spot ($500K - $20M revenue)
- Local/regional focus

## Unified Positioning

> "We help passion-driven service professionals - from lawyers to plumbers, dentists to dog trainers - get the AI clarity they need to stop wasting time on admin and get back to the work they love."

## Scoring Criteria Used

1. Growth
2. Adoption ability

5. Interest in AI solutions (verified)
6. High degree of measurable inefficiency

- ~~Hotels/Hospitality~~ (slow enterprise decisions)
- ~~Music Studios~~ (budget constraints)
