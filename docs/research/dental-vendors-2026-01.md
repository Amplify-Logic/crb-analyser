## Needs Manual Verification

| Vendor | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| **HeyGent** | Website not verified. Limited public information. |
| **Greaten AI** | Newer player. Claims need verification. |
| **DentalTap** | Free tier mentioned but limited details available. |
| **ACE Dental** | $499 one-time mentioned. On-premise legacy system. Verify if still actively developed. |
| **Denticon** | DSO-focused. Reports of rising fees and declining service. Verify current status. |

---

## Excluded (with reasons)

| Vendor | Reason for Exclusion |
|--------|----------------------|
| **DentiMax** | Limited differentiation from competitors. Mixed reviews on support. |
| **ABELDent** | Canadian-focused. May not be optimal for US practices. |
| **Softdent** | Legacy system. Integration issues reported with modern tools. |
| **Generic AI chatbots** | Not dental-specific. Lack HIPAA compliance and PMS integrations. |
