| Industry specificity | Social proof line + quiz personalization (segmented pages later) |
| Simplification | Keep structure, tighten copy throughout |
| Interactive UI emphasis | Highlight in hero subtitle |

### Validated Claims

## Section-by-Section Changes

### 1. Hero Section

**Before:**
```
Badge: "No fluff. No false promises. Just clarity."
H1: "Find Out Where AI Actually Makes Sense for Your Business"
Subtitle: "A 90-minute workshop that produces a genuinely useful AI roadmap."
```

**After:**
```
Badge: "What used to cost €15,000 now costs €147"

H1: "AI Clarity in 48 Hours, Not 6 Weeks"

Subtitle: "Get an unbiased Cost-Risk-Benefit analysis delivered as
an interactive web report—with live ROI calculators, vendor comparisons,
and a visual implementation roadmap."

Trust line (new):
"No vendor agenda. No consulting upsell. Just what's best for you and your customers."

Industry proof (new):
"Built for service businesses—dental, legal, home services, recruiting, coaching, and beyond."

CTA buttons: [Start Free Quiz →]  [See Sample Report]

Micro-copy: "Free quiz: 5 min • Full workshop: 90 min • Report from €147"
```

**Rationale:**
- Badge carries cost-collapse message (first thing they see)
- H1 is the GTM one-liner from gtm-insights doc
- Subtitle highlights interactive web UI differentiator
- Trust line emphasizes unbiased nature (moat vs consultants)
- Industry proof is inclusive ("and beyond")

---

### 2. Value Props Section

**Before:**
```
1. "No BS Assessment"
   "We tell you what NOT to do. That's often more valuable than what to do."

2. "Real Pricing, Real Data"
   "Actual vendor costs, not guesses. We do the research so you can make informed decisions."

3. "Gold In, Gold Out"
   "Quality analysis requires quality input. Your effort in the workshop shapes every recommendation."
```

**After:**
```
1. "No BS Assessment"
   "We tell you what NOT to do—that's often more valuable than what to do.
   No vendor agenda, just honest recommendations."

2. "Real Pricing, Real Data"
   "Actual vendor costs and industry benchmarks, not guesses.
   ROI calculations with visible assumptions you can trust."

3. "Built to Keep Learning"
   "Your analysis benefits from patterns across our growing network.
   Better insights for your industry, every time."
```

**Rationale:**
- Prop 1: Added unbiased angle
- Prop 2: Tightened, kept honesty about assumptions
- Prop 3: NEW - hints at learning loop / expertise system (proprietary data moat)

---

### 3. "Let's Be Honest" Section

**Before:** 3 paragraphs

**After:**
```
Title: "Let's be honest upfront"

"This isn't a magic 5-minute quiz. Our workshop takes 90 minutes
because generic questions = generic answers = useless report.

The quality of your report depends on the quality of your input.
Rush through it, get a rushed report. Take it seriously, get
insights worth 100x what you paid."
```

**Rationale:** Cut from 3 paragraphs to 2. Same message, half the words.

---

### 4. Sample Findings Section

**Before & After:** Minimal changes - structure works well

```
Section title: "What honest findings look like"
Subtitle: "We don't just say 'implement AI.' We tell you what makes
sense, what doesn't, and why."

Card 1: Customer Support Automation
Verdict: "Go for it" (green)
"Your ticket volume and response patterns make this a clear win."
Potential: €24,000/year | Confidence: High

Card 2: AI Content Generation
Verdict: "Proceed with caution" (yellow)
"Potential is there, but your brand voice needs definition first."
Potential: €8,000/year | Confidence: Medium

Card 3: Predictive Analytics
Verdict: "Not yet" (gray)
"Your data infrastructure needs work before this makes sense."
Potential: Deferred | Confidence: High
```

**Rationale:** Already demonstrates honest, unbiased approach. Minor copy tightening only.

---

### 5. How It Works Section

**Before:** 4 steps with longer descriptions

**After:**
```
Section title: "How it works"
Subtitle: "From quick quiz to comprehensive roadmap"

Step 1: "Take the free quiz" (5 min)
"See your AI readiness score and a preview of opportunities."

Step 2: "Complete the workshop" (90 min)
"Deep-dive questions about your operations. Better answers = better report."

Step 3: "AI analyzes everything" (24-48 hrs)
"We research your industry, benchmark your operations, and build your report."

Step 4: "Get your interactive report" (Delivered)
"Specific recommendations with real pricing, honest ROI, and clear next steps."
```

**Rationale:**
- Descriptions trimmed ~20%
- Step 4: "roadmap" → "interactive report" (reinforces web UI differentiator)

---

### 6. Pricing Section

**Before:** 2 tiers, repeated feature lists

**After:**
```
Section title: "Simple, transparent pricing"
Subtitle: "Start with the report, add expert guidance if you need it."

---

**Before:**
```
"Ready to find out what actually makes sense?"

```

**After:**
```
Title: "Ready to find out what actually makes sense?"

Subtitle: "What consultants charge €15,000 for, you can get for €147.
Start with the free quiz—no commitment, no tricks."

Button: [Take the Free Quiz]
```

**Rationale:**
- Bookends page with cost-collapse message (badge at top, CTA at bottom)
- Tightened to one punchy line

---

- No new components needed - copy changes only
- Keep existing animations and structure
- Test on mobile - hero text may need responsive adjustments
