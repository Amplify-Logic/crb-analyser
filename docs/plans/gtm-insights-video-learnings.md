## Core Principles

### 1. Lean Into Your Experience
- Build for domains you know deeply
- Your 5+ years of experience = unfair advantage
- **CRB Application:** Target industries we understand (professional services, home services, dental)

### 2. Solve One Specific Problem
- Don't try to build "the next Facebook"
- Laser focus on one pain point
- **CRB Application:** AI implementation clarity for confused SMB owners

### 3. Timing / "Spawn Camping"
- Watch for model capability jumps ("fertile planes")
- New models = new opportunities
- Position at intersection of capability + market need
- **CRB Application:** We're at the intersection of powerful AI + SMB AI confusion

### 4. One-Sentence Clarity
- Must explain product in 1-2 sentences
- Landing page = instant understanding
- 30-second demo video max
- **CRB Target:** "Get AI clarity in 48 hours, not 6 weeks"

### 5. Clicks to Conversion
- Track: how many clicks to see value?
- Remove every roadblock
- Optimize ruthlessly for simplicity

### 6. Don't Fear Big Companies
- They're slow, bureaucratic
- Make money in the 12-24 month window
- Build to be acquired or build the moat

## Marketing Channels

### X (Twitter) - Primary Recommendation
- "Algo is as good as TikTok was in 2018"
- Low barrier to entry (just text)
- Rewards builders showing their work
- Target: SMB owners, AI-curious business owners, industry-specific communities

**Tactics:**
1. Post "Need an AI audit for your [industry]?" - capture responses
2. Document the build publicly
3. Share insights from audits (anonymized)
4. Retarget engagers with paid ads

### Paid Traffic
- Learning curve, but works
- Expect sunken cost while learning
- 6-month threshold before deciding "not for me"
- Warm traffic (from organic) converts better

## Application to Report Quality

These principles apply to making reports great, not just marketing:

| Principle | Report Application |
|-----------|-------------------|
| One-sentence clarity | Each finding = one clear headline |
| Remove roadblocks | Recommendations immediately actionable |
| Make hard simple | Complex ROI → simple visual + confidence |
| Solve one issue well | One problem + one solution per finding |
| Clicks to conversion | Report → action, not just information |
