## FAQ

**Q: What if they don't finish in 2 weeks?**
A: The sprint ends when the sprint ends. Offer another sprint or point them to async support. Don't let scope creep.

**Q: What if they go dark during the sprint?**
A: Ping them twice. If no response, the sprint clock keeps running. Make this clear in kickoff.

**Q: What if the tool they need isn't in our KB?**
A: Research it. Add it to KB. Now you have it for future clients.

**Q: What if they want something custom-built?**
A: "That's outside this sprint's scope. Our sprint is for setting up off-the-shelf tools. For custom builds, I can refer you to [partner/agency]."
