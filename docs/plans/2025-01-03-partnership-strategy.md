# Partnership Strategy: Software Vendor & Implementation Partners

## Executive Summary

Software partnership model (getting leads from AI/SaaS platforms, rev-share with implementation partners) can add 5-10% additional revenue at scale. **Not worth pursuing until core product has volume.**

---

## The Model

```
Software Vendor (has confused users)
        ↓ sends leads
CRB Analyser (analyzes, recommends)
        ↓ warm handoff
Implementation Partner (builds/integrates)
        ↓ rev share back to us
```

**Why it works for others:**
- Lionus: 150 projects/4 months, €30-42K/month, 80% margins
- Zero CAC (leads from software partners)
- 100% conversion (leads pre-qualified by partner)
- Productized offers (€1K/8hrs, €2K/16hrs)

**Why we wait:**
- Requires volume to be attractive to partners
- Distraction from core product-market fit
- Partnership revenue is additive, not transformational

---

## Phased Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current → 50 reports/month)

**Focus:** Core product only. No partnership work.

**Do now (2 hours total):**
- [ ] Add to report: "Need help implementing? Reply to this email"
- [ ] Track which vendors appear most in recommendations (build into product)

**Revenue from partnerships:** €0

---

### Phase 2: Soft Partnerships (50+ reports/month)

**Trigger:** Consistent 50+ reports/month for 2 consecutive months

**Actions:**
| Task | Effort | Revenue |
|------|--------|---------|
| List 2-3 implementation partners per industry in reports | 4 hrs once | Affiliate 10-15% |
| Informal outreach to top 3 vendors we recommend | 2 hrs/week | Relationship building |
| Add affiliate tracking | 4 hrs once | Data collection |

**Total effort:** ~4 hours/week ongoing
**Revenue from partnerships:** €500-1,500/month

---

### Phase 3: Active Partnerships (100+ reports/month)

**Trigger:** Consistent 100+ reports/month for 2 consecutive months

**Actions:**
| Task | Effort | Revenue |
|------|--------|---------|
| Formal implementation partner program | 8 hrs setup, 2 hrs/week | 15-20% rev share |
| Vendor lead-fee agreements | 4 hrs/vendor | €50-100/qualified lead |
| White-label pilot (1 vendor) | 20 hrs setup, 4 hrs/week | €2-5K/month |

**Total effort:** ~12 hours/week ongoing
**Revenue from partnerships:** €3,000-8,000/month

## Revenue Projections

| Monthly Reports | Direct Revenue | Partnership Revenue | % of Total |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| 20 | €4,000 | €0 | 0% |
| 50 | €10,000 | €500-1,000 | 5-10% |
| 100 | €20,000 | €3,000-5,000 | 15-20% |
| 200 | €40,000 | €8,000-15,000 | 17-27% |
