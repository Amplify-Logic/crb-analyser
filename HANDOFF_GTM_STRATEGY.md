## Task: Research Best GTM Path with No/Small Budget

### Research Questions

1. **Channel Discovery**
   - Where do SMB decision-makers hang out online?
   - Which communities/forums discuss AI for business?
   - What podcasts do they listen to?
   - Which newsletters do they read?

2. **Content Strategy**
   - What content format works best for this audience?
   - What topics would attract our ideal customer?
   - How to demonstrate expertise without giving away the product?
   - Case study opportunities?

3. **Distribution Tactics**
   - LinkedIn organic strategies that work in 2024/2025
   - Reddit communities to engage (not spam)
   - Twitter/X for B2B SaaS
   - SEO opportunities (long-tail keywords)
   - YouTube/video content ROI

4. **Partnership Opportunities**
   - Who serves our audience but isn't competitive?
   - Affiliate/referral program structures
   - White-label opportunities
   - Integration partnerships (Zapier, etc.)

5. **Paid Experiments (Small Budget)**
   - If we had €500/month, where to spend it?
   - Meta ads for B2B - does it work?
   - Google Ads for high-intent keywords
   - Sponsored newsletter placements

6. **Launch Strategies**
   - Product Hunt launch playbook
   - AppSumo/lifetime deal considerations
   - Beta tester acquisition
   - Early adopter incentives

### Competitive Intelligence

Research how similar tools got traction:
- Jasper AI (how did they grow?)
- Copy.ai
- Notion (their early growth)
- Airtable
- Other AI consulting tools

### Framework for Evaluation

For each channel/tactic, evaluate:
1. **Effort**: Time/skill required
2. **Cost**: Money required
3. **Speed**: Time to first results
4. **Scalability**: Can it grow with us?
5. **Fit**: Does it match our brand (honest, impartial)?

### Specific Questions to Answer

1. Should we focus on one industry vertical first? Which one?
2. Is the free quiz enough to drive organic sharing?
3. What's the minimum viable content strategy?
4. How do we get first 100 paying customers?
5. What's the CAC we can afford at €47 and €297 price points?

### Constraints

- Budget: €0-500/month initially
- Team: Solo founder (limited time)
- Timeline: Want paying customers within 60 days
- Brand: Must maintain honest/impartial positioning

### Output Expected

1. **Prioritized Channel List**: Top 3-5 channels to focus on
2. **30-Day Action Plan**: Specific daily/weekly activities
3. **Content Calendar**: First month of content ideas
4. **Metrics to Track**: What to measure, what's a good result
5. **Quick Wins**: Things that can generate results this week
